                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    I work as the community manager for Pods--a free WordPress development framework. As part of my job I provide support, manage documentation, and create educational materials. Since I began working as the community manager for Pods last August I've been focused on improving the documentation and other educational materials available for Pods. We've created a <a title="Pods Tutorials" href="http://pods.io/tutorials/" target="_blank">new tutorials section</a> full of tutorials I wrote as well as those I curated from the community. I've also added and expanded doc pages and created <a title="Pods How-To Screencast Series" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EZyKLP9vWGMKDbUYL650o12gZ10qOpp" target="_blank">a screencast series on how to use Pods</a>. As part of my job with Pods I also provide support, do bug testing and improve the help resources in the plugin itself.

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    One of the things I love about WordPress is the supportive community and the incredible amount of educational resources from tutorials to screencasts to WordCamps as well as the variosu support sites and groups. It is because of the generosity of those who create and provide all of these resources that I am able to do anything more than write the most basic HTML tags. I love being able to give back to the community that has given me so much by writing about WordPress.

                    I have contributed content to <a href="http://jpwp.me/WPMU" target="_blank">WPMU</a>, <a href="http://jpwp.me/wpbeginner" target="_blank">Wpbeginner</a> and <a href="http://jpwp.me/torque" target="_blank">Torque</a>.

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    My theme <a href="http://joshpress.net/themes/downloads/_second-foundation/" target="_blank">_Second Foundation</a> is a starter theme based on the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com" target="_blank">Foundation framework</a>. I also wrote two child themes for Twenty Fourteen that center the content and add other capabilities. <a href="http://joshpress.net/themes/downloads/the-falcon/?theme=TheFalcon" target="_blank">One theme is called The Falcon</a>, because I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and features a mobile slide-out menu and a header that rearranges itself when scrolled--based on my own jQuery and has a user-configurable gradient background. Creating The Falcon led to <a href="http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-make-twenty-fourteen-or-any-other-wp-theme-super/" target="_blank">an article about child themeing for Twenty Fourteen</a>, which I wrote with <a href="http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/author/chrisdknowles/" target="_blank">Chris Knowles</a>. We wrote a modified version of The Falcon, called <a href="http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/awesome_2014.zip" target="_blank">Awesome 2014</a> for that article. Awesome 2014 uses the Sidr jQuery plugin for it's slide-out sidebar and has a solid background as well as some additional options for the featured content section.

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    My plugin, JP Theme Bar, adds a theme switching bar to the bottom of your site, perfect for theme preview sites. I wrote it so I could use it and to teach myself the Settings and Options APIs. It is based on the <a href="http://iainjmccallum.com/wordpress/live-demo-theme-bar/" target="_blank">IJM Theme Switcher Bar</a> v2.0 by<a href="http://www.iainjmccallum.com/" target="_blank"> Iain J McCallum</a>. I rewrote the original plugin into object oriented PHP, added some filters, simplified the jQuery and rearranged the admin page.

            <p class="section-paragraph">
                I started learning WordPress development when I was supposed to be working on his masters thesis in environmental studies, which ended up being about open-source solutions for sustainable design and was presented in a WordPress site. I am currently in the earliest phases of developing the technology and the business that <a href="http://HoloTree.com">I imagined in my thesis</a>. My goal is to use WordPress to develop tools that help people work together globally in order to strengthen communities and create local solutions to ecological issues while earning a right livelihood. I am continuing to learn about WordPress and PHP not only because I love it and it provides my income but so I can make this dream a reality.
